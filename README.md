# Project
This project is about a program to help you get the best deals on your shopping list. 
For this project you'll be writing a program to help me get the best deals on my shopping list. I've
gathered the inventories of a few local stores, so I can track what items they have in stock and how
much they are selling things for. With that information (and knowing what I need to purchase), I can
assemble a list of what I need to purchase from each location.
